# HyperDecimal
BigDecimal is too slow maybe, and a next-generation structure is needed for accurate real number computation.
Create multiple scenarios and compare performance and accuracy with Big-Decimal to find the optimal structure.

# Scenario
- [Scenario 1] (https://github.com/Brian-LEE0/HyperDecimal/blob/main/scenario1/README.md)

# Reference
